# A Disorganised Collection of Neural Network Experiments
**Warning:** This repo won't be very useful, it's more of a timecapsule of my June 2022 at the University of Cambridge.

## Postmortem

Looking back on this now (Oct 2023), I think my abilities at the time were limited (silly fresher) in terms of organisation, and general project planning. Note: *In partial defence of my 19 year old self, the tutoring itself was, at times, unstructured.*

If I were to redo this, I'd be sure to have something more presentable and structured, like my [Maze Solver Notebook](https://github.com/jamespilcher/maze-solver/blob/master/Maze-Solver.ipynb)... I wrote this just for me and me only, but worse than that, it was exclusively for **June 2022** me. I think that was a mistake. In any case, it was a great learning experience and I'm grateful for the opportunity.

## Key takeawys
- Wrote a neural network from scratch using pure NumPy arrays.
- Toyed with and learnt computer vision techniques.
- Applied pretrained models to a live webcam.

## Set up

See `requirements.txt`

Don't see `scrap_code` or the majority of this repo for that matter...

## Unfinished report

After the internship, I began writing a summary of my time there. I got 2000 words in before I got busy (and a bit lazy) and stopped writing. You can read it  `machine-learning-internship.md` if you dare, although some images I missing - one of the detection models labelled my white shoe and airplane, and we called it the 'Adversarial Sneaker'.

## Lessons Learned

Unfortunately, demonstrating and documenting is just as important as learning. Not just so you can show off, but so you can always time-travel back and learn what you have forgotten.
